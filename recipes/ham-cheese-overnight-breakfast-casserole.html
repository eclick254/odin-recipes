        This delicious and easy breakfast casserole is a great way to use leftover cooked ham, but you can also substitute cooked bacon to change it up. You can make it the night before so all you have to do is bake it in the morning. If you're short on time or forgot to prep this the night before, it can also be made the same morning. The recipe yields 8 servings. Nutritional quantity per serving: 414 calories; protein 29g; carbohydrates 13.8g; fat 26.6g; cholesterol 337.9mg; sodium 1208.6mg.
